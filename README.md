# Facial Recognition Using Neural Networks
## Data analysis (Computer Vision)

### Introduction
Face detection is a computer vision technology that helps to locate/visualize human faces in digital images. This project is a specific use case of object detection technology that deals with detecting faces using webcam or screen recording. With the advent of technology, face detection has gained a lot of importance especially in fields like photography, security, and marketing.

### Pre-requisites
* Python
* Numpy
* OpenCV

### Details
* Use webcam or screen recording to detect and label faces using OpenCV libraries
* Use the facial recognition system to create an attendance by logging the attendance live in an excel sheet
* Implemented the facial recognition in quadcopter drone for object tracking using DJI Tello
